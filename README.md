**@Mission**

Since TypeScript 5.2, stage 3 decorator metadata is now natively available and ready for use, however *very few* projects utilize the feature. TS Metadata hopes to build a standard set of decorators for popular web standards like [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/), [HAL](https://stateless.co/hal_specification.html), and others to enable runtime interpretation of classes, their fields, and their methods.
